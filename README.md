# DobDark Theme

A dark syntax theme for Sublime Text 2.

## Description

This colour scheme has been designed for clarity with vibrant
highlights and cool greys. Colours have been carefully picked and
tweaked to offer good contrast between elements. It also has a couple
of interesting ideas that might appeal to markup authors in
particular:

1. Highlighting for markup such as HTML and XML subtly brings to the
fore the actual content of the elements, rather than the tags
themselves. Attribute values, which could also be considered a form of
content, have more prominence than tags. The tags themselves are
styled with a neutral grey which, while being perfectly legible, can
be easily ignored if you're focusing on content. The result is a
hierarchy of highlighting that makes it much easier to read markup.

2. Comments are given less prominence. They fade into the background
through use of a low-contrast grey. This subtly reduces the noise
comments can sometimes cause, but still enables the comments to be
easily looked at when you want to.

Dobdark also comes with great support for Markdown and
reStructuredText highlighting, plus the SublimeLinter and Bracket
Highlighter packages.

[Cousine](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Cousine) by Ascender
Corporation's Steve Matteson. It renders exquisitely under Windows
ClearType thanks to its superb hinting.
